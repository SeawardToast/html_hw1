  <h1>About Aidan</h1>
  <p>My name is Aidan Murphy. I am born and raised in Suwanee, Georgia and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am pursuing a career in software development and I am currently employed as a Software Engineering intern at Pegasystems. I am taking this class in order to broaden my knowledge on the software development life cycle, specifically in the architecture and design stages. My hobbies include playing soccer, going hiking and camping, hanging out with friends and listening to music. BASSNECTAR!!!!</p>

<h1>Aidan's Cars</h1>
<p1>If you know me you know I love cars. I got my first Jeep at age 15 and fell in love immediately. I began putting modifications on it left and right, spending every cent I made on more Jeep parts. It is a 1998 Jeep Cherokee and unfortunately is not running currently.</p1>
